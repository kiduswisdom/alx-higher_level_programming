SQL - Introduction

This was my first project in which I began to work with SQL and relational databases. I began practicing introductory data definition and data manipulation language, making subqueries, and using functions.
Usage 🐬

    Scripts 3-list_tables.sql forward take the database to query from as a MySQL command line argument.

$ cat 3-list_tables.sql | mysql -h localhost -u root -p mysql

    Tasks 101-103 query from the database temperatures.sql.
