Python - if/else, loops, functions

In this project, I began utilizing conditionals and loops in Python by using if, if ... else, break, continue, pass, and range statements with while and for loops. I practiced writing my own Python functions while learning about scope of variables, tracebacks, and arithmetic operators.
